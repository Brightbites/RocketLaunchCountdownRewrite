RocketLaunchCountdown is a python and HTML system to operate a launch countdown and go/nogo indicator. The go/nogo indicator is operated either by a spreadsheet, using a sharelink inserted in the settings windows. Or there are buttons in the app that can manage it as well. Which mode is used is dictated by a simple radio button in the settings window.
